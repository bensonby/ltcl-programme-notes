Four Rhapsodies, Op 11
composer
Ernő Dohnányi (1877-1960)
1902/3; Vienna; dedicated to István Thomán

No 1 in G minor: Allegro non troppo, ma agitato[8'55]
No 2 in F sharp minor: Adagio capriccioso[7'34]
No 3 in C major: Vivace[5'07]
No 4 in E flat minor: Andante lugubre[7'27]

In the autumn of 1901 Dohnányi settled in Vienna. It was here that he composed his Four Rhapsodies, Op 11, which he dedicated to István Thomán. As Dohnányi later told his third wife and biographer Ilona von Dohnányi, this work
can be considered as a sonata in four movements: the first Rhapsody is the first movement, because it has a simpler form; the second Rhapsody replaces the slow movement; the third corresponds to a scherzo of a sonata; the last Rhapsody, an elaboration of the Gregorian chant ‘Dies Irae’, includes the themes of the former three Rhapsodies. I did not call the work ‘sonata’, because its structure is somewhat looser and each piece can be performed separately.
While some listeners have identified a Hungarian flavour to the work, especially in the Rhapsody in F sharp minor, Dohnányi eschewed such attributions. He insisted that the individual movements ‘are not rhapsodies in the sense of the Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt, in which Hungarian folksongs are elaborated. My themes are all original, and when people find that their style is Hungarian, it is because I am Hungarian.’

### Reviews

‘The auspices are good even before you press the play button … a master pianist who has thoroughly immersed himself in the composer for years … a particularly happy start to the series’ (Gramophone)
‘Martin Roscoe performs these memorable virtuoso showpieces with tremendous panache and musical sensitivity … Roscoe's control of timbre is utterly magical … a charismatic and witty performance’ (BBC Music Magazine)
‘Works some of which are the most winning of the late Romantic era … Roscoe finds the ideal blend of lightness and broad lyrical sweep … a programme that refreshes some gorgeous, unjustly neglected music’ (The Daily Telegraph)
‘Roscoe's immaculate pianism, probing musical imagination and, above all, sympathy with Dohnányi's expressive ways and means make him the ideal interpreter for such a comprehensive retrospective’ (International Record Review)

Even Hungarian composer Ernő Dohnányi's best-known work, the Variations on a Nursery Theme, for piano and orchestra, rarely crops up on concert programmes nowadays. But in his lifetime, Dohnányi (1877-1960) was a hugely influential figure, who was at various times the director of the Liszt Academy in Budapest, in charge of the music output of the Hungarian Radio Corporation, and musical director of the Budapest Philharmonic, as well as composing and pursuing parallel careers as a pianist and a teacher – his pupils included Geza Anda, Annie Fischer and Georg Solti.

Though he was born only four years before Béla Bartók, Dohnányi's own music belonged to an entirely different generation of Hungarian composers, and it seems as if modernism hardly left any mark on his style at all. Instead, his works for piano stem directly from the high Romanticism of Liszt, and it's that bravura approach that makes this first instalment of Martin Roscoe's four-disc survey of Dohnányi's complete piano music so enjoyable.

The disc is made up of collections of genre pieces, though the Four Rhapsodies Op 11 do follow the outline of a substantial sonata, complete with a scherzo that unfurls a sumptuously ripe melody as its trio section, and the 10 Winterreigen, each one dedicated to one of Dohnányi's friends, do hark back to Schumann's piano cycles. There's something larger than life about the keyboard writing here, and it demands exactly the kind of no-holds-barred approach that Roscoe adopts; he dispatches the fistfuls of notes with wonderful precision and just the right degree of swagger.

## Thesis

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1023.4796&rep=rep1&type=pdf

The Four Rhapsodies, op. 11 of Ernst von Dohnányi are among his most popular
and most highly regarded compositions for the piano. Yet, there have been no serious
studies of these pieces, either individually or as a set. The purpose of this thesis is to
provide a clear understanding of Dohnányi‟s unique stylistic compositional elements in
these pieces. Texture and form are the most indicative characteristics of his rhapsodic
language because of the improvisational nature that permeates his compositional style in
the rhapsodies.
Within the chapter on texture, rhythm and accompanimental figurations are
examined. The chapter on form focuses on the individual movements of the whole set and
then reveals how all four rhapsodies function together as a large-scale work. Each
rhapsody‟s structural organization, including references to eighteenth-century forms, and
the cyclical elements in the work are analyzed. 

Table 3. Structural Organization of Rhapsody in C Major, op. 11, no. 3
| Section | Measures | Sub-sections | Key | Theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
| A | 1-84 | a (mm. 1-34); a1 (mm. 35-84) | C Major; E Minor | Theme I
| B | 85-151 | b (mm. 85-119); b1 (mm. 119-151) | C Major | Theme II
| A1 | 152-230 | a2 (mm. 152-210); a3 (mm. 211-230) | G Major | Theme I
| C | 231-289 | c (mm. 231-289) | C Major | Theme I of Rhapsody no. 1
| B1 | 290-360 | b (mm. 290-324) b1 (mm. 324-360) | C Major | Theme II
| Coda | 361-395 | C Major | Theme I

With an omission of the A section in between the C and B1
sections, this rhapsody does
not follow the conventional construction of the rondo form (ABACA), but the link to
rondo form is evident. 

#### Cyclical Elements in the Four Rhapsodies, op.11

Cyclical elements unify the Four Rhapsodies, op. 11, so that the four rhapsodies
may be considered a set: beginning with the second rhapsody, each of the rhapsodies
quotes themes from the previous ones in the opus. Thus, the whole work becomes a
grandiose “cycle.”
Third Rhapsody
The “head” of the first rhapsody‟s opening theme returns also in the C section
(mm. 231-289) of the third rhapsody (see Table 3), again is transformed. The first three
chromatic descending top notes of the opening theme are modified into a simpler melodic
line supported by a thinner texture, as shown in the example below (Example 14).
Example 14. Dohnányi, Rhapsody in C Major, op. 11, no. 3, mm. 231-234

The entire C section is based on this motive of the opening theme which now is
accompanied by a two-note ostinato in the bass and an ostinato in thirds in the middle
voices.

CONCLUSION
Dohnányi continued the tradition of rhapsody writing by composing his Four
Rhapsodies, op. 11. Although Dohnányi‟s compositional style is related to two other
Romantics, Liszt and Brahms, Dohnányi managed to convey in his intense personal
idiom through textural and formal inventiveness in op. 11. Dohnányi‟s four rhapsodies
may be described as a written-out extemporaneous work. This particular characteristic is
strongly emphasized by his employment of certain rhythmic patterns such as quintuplets
and variable rhythmic mixtures, which concurrently appear with gypsy flavored
accompanimental figurations. Dohnányi‟s improvisatory writing is also evident in op.
11‟s formal structure. While composing each individual rhapsody in free-sectionalized
form within the enclosure of classical formal ideas, op. 11, as a set, is unified by thematic
transformation. Thus, his success of developing small ideas into a larger scale work is
regarded as a genuine and distinguished rhapsodic idiom.
Through the examination of smaller elements of texture and form, op.11‟s
rhapsodies are seen as characteristically personal improvisatory works. At the same time,
when considered as a whole, these compositions comprise a tightly bound formal
structure. The individual forms, together with Dohnányi‟s spontaneous and virtuosic
piano writing, define his unique rhapsodic language. The whole set projects a broad
spectrum of rhapsodic divergence that deserves to be examined and performed.

Dohnanyi died in 1960 at the age of 82, but (as he pointed out ruefully when he came to the Edinburgh Festival in 1956) he had long grown accustomed to people being surprised to find him still alive. He also suffered the fate of becoming known in many European countries as a one-work composer, on the strength of the clever Nursery Song Variations. In his native Hungary, he is now respected as a pioneering and significant figure. These piano works indicate the virtuosity that was so highly praised, but also a romantic world of ideas that was to remain with him. So although he was the most important of his countrymen to support Bartok, it was the younger man who helped to supplant him.
This is not quite fair. The Op. 2 Pieces, extremely well played here by Martin Roscoe, certainly inhabit the world of Brahms, whose voice is also heard resounding behind the opening sweep of the first Op. 11 Rhapsody. Rachmaninov also offers a helping hand, not only in the obvious associations caused by Dohnanyi's clever use of the Dies irae in the fourth Rhapsody (Andante lugubre). The best of the set is the lively C major Rhapsody, No. 3, which turns up in recitals from time to time. It has a cheery insouciance, together with a wryly warm central melody, that looks (surprisingly) in the direction of Paris and in particular some of Milhaud. With the Three Pieces of Op. 23 Schumannesque allusions in No. 1 give way to tonal side-slips and a faintly nostalgic air that would hardly be as they are without the example of Richard Strauss. So, it has to be said, there is enjoyable music here but not the revelation of a composer with a very strong creative individuality to balance his tremendous mastery. It is none the less sympathetic, intelligent music, matched in Roscoe's expert performances.'
