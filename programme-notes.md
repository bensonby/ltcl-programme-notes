Ernő Dohnányi (1877-1960)
Four Rhapsodies, Op. 11 No. 3
6min0sec

The Hungarian composer Dohnanyi composed the rhapsody in 1901 in Vienna. The Four Rhapsodies are similar to a sonata with 4 movements, with the third one (No. 3) as the scherzo. The third one is the only one in the four rhapsodies which is in the major key (C major), and is fast (marked Vivace), energetic and sonorous, with a warm lyrical theme in the middle sections.

This rhapsody basically follows the ABACB form with an introduction and a coda. The piece starts with a brilliant opening phrase with two question-and-answers. The second answer which is in the mediant key leads to the A section. The A section contains elements of humor, such as accented notes and chromatic scales played on the high and low register like a conversation. The B section is a warm theme in the dominant key, less vigorous section than A, with a more tonal melody featuring the use of octaves, accompanied by passionate triplet arpeggios.

The section A then appears again in the dominant key, where it develops through a passage contains the accented four notes fragment, chromatic scales (and also in thirds), and enters the C section. The theme of C section, the long notes on top of the ostinato accompaniment, is based on the first theme of the first rhapsody (Op 11 No 1). The theme develops and reaches the climax at a series of octaves in the bass at ascending chromatic scales and in the top line as pairs of stepwise going upwards.

The section B returns, this time at the tonic key, and it leads to the coda which contains fragments of the A section.

Gabriel Faure (?-?)
Nocturne No. 6 in D flat major, Op. 63
8min30sec

Faure is a French composer, whose nocturnes and barcarolles are the more well-known among his piano works. He wrote 13 nocturnes, where the 6th one is written in 1894, after a six-year period without piano compositions. This nocturne in D flat major is regarded as one of the best in the series, and as the work that shows his unique style of music, away from Chopin's shadow.

The nocturne follows the ABCA? form. The piece starts with an emotional mood. With the accompaniment in form of tripets, the melody falling on the second note of a triplet instead of on the half note.

The second theme is in the enharmonic equivalent minor (C# minor), still in triple meter but on eight notes instead of triplets. It also features the use syncopation in the accompaniments. It builds up to the re-occurence of the end of the first theme, and then the third theme follows. The third theme starts with a short introduction and then changes to is in quadruple meter with a contemplative dream-like melody, accompanied by broken chords.

The second theme follows and it builds up more intensely to a reappearance of the third theme, and further to the climax through ascending scales from the bass, combination of semiquavers and triplets. The ascending diminishing scales mark the end of the climax. The first theme returns after a long pause. The nocturne ends in transquil after a final octave phrase build-up.
