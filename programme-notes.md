Ernő Dohnányi (1877-1960)
Four Rhapsodies, Op. 11 No. 3
6min0sec

The Hungarian composer Dohnanyi composed the rhapsody in 1901 in Vienna. The Four Rhapsodies are similar to a sonata with 4 movements, with the third one (No. 3) as the scherzo. The third one is the only one in the four rhapsodies which is in the major key (C major), and is fast (marked Vivace), energetic and sonorous, with a warm lyrical theme in the middle sections.

This rhapsody basically follows the ABACB form with an introduction and a coda. The piece starts with a brilliant opening phrase with two question-and-answers. The second answer which is in the mediant key leads to the A section. The A section contains elements of humor, such as accented notes and chromatic scales played on the high and low register like a conversation. The B section is a warm theme in the dominant key, less vigorous section than A, with a more tonal melody featuring the use of octaves, accompanied by passionate triplet arpeggios.

The section A then appears again in the dominant key, where it develops through a passage contains the accented four notes fragment, chromatic scales (and also in thirds), and enters the C section. The theme of C section, the long notes on top of the ostinato accompaniment, is based on the first theme of the first rhapsody (Op 11 No 1). The theme develops and reaches the climax at a series of octaves in the bass at ascending chromatic scales and in the top line as pairs of stepwise going upwards.

The section B returns, this time at the tonic key, and it leads to the coda which contains fragments of the A section.

Gabriel Faure (?-?)
Nocturne No. 6 in D flat major, Op. 63
8min30sec

Faure is a French composer, whose nocturnes and barcarolles are the more well-known among his piano works. He wrote 13 nocturnes, where the 6th one is written in 1894, after a six-year period without piano compositions. This nocturne in D flat major is regarded as one of the best in the series, and as the work that shows his unique style of music, away from Chopin's shadow.

The nocturne follows the ABCA? form. The piece starts with an emotional mood. With the accompaniment in form of tripets, the melody falling on the second note of a triplet instead of on the half note.

The second theme is in the enharmonic equivalent minor (C# minor), still in triple meter but on eight notes instead of triplets. It also features the use syncopation in the accompaniments. It builds up to the re-occurence of the end of the first theme, and then the third theme follows. The third theme starts with a short introduction and then changes to is in quadruple meter with a contemplative dream-like melody, accompanied by broken chords.

The second theme follows and it builds up more intensely to a reappearance of the third theme, and further to the climax through ascending scales from the bass, combination of semiquavers and triplets. The ascending diminishing scales mark the end of the climax. The first theme returns after a long pause. The nocturne ends in transquil after a final octave phrase build-up.

Joseph Haydn (?-?)
Piano Sonata in C, No. 60 Hob.XVI/50
(show movement list)
16min

The Piano Sonata in C, No. 60, along with the Sonata No. 62 in E flat major, is dedicated to Therese Jansen Bartolozzi who is a virtuoso English pianist. With Therese as the recipient of the sonata, Haydn writes this piece which requires more advanced techniques, and also explores the new pedals in the pianoforte as the piano building technology had advanced. This piece is considered as one of the greatest sonatas written by Haydn.

The sonata is in three movements. The first movement is in sonata form as a typical composition form in the classical period. The exposition starts with a "curious" theme beginning with the tonic going down the tonic triad, with a tonic counterpoint throughout. The second theme is in the dominant key and consists of scales and counter-melodies. The development section starts in the dominant minor with scales on the top and the theme in minor in the bass. There is a "open pedal" section which is where Haydn experiments with the new pedals in the pianoforte.

The slow second movement is in the subdominant key (F major). It is in ternary form, with a lyrical opening melody. The first section changes to the dominant key (C major) and ends through a series of descending major scales. The B section starts in C minor and ends with a downward arpeggio of the dominant seventh of the tonic key. As the A section reappear, it remains at the tonic key in the middle through a short bridge in the minor key.

The third movement is in the tonic key in triple meter and has a hint of humor. The melody is often interrupted by a fermata in the intermediate phrases.

Fazil Say (1970-)
Paganini Jazz Op. 5e
(show movement list)
8m

Fazil Say is a Turkish pianist and composer. The Caprice No. 24 in A minor written by Niccolo Paganini is a very famous work for solo violin. And Say has transformed it into a theme and variation piece in jazz virtuoso style, originally used as an encore work in 1988. The variations are edited and expanded between 1988 and 1995.

There are six variations (not counting the three extra variations) written in different jazz styles. The theme uses powerful octaves and with syncopations towards the end of the first two sub-phrases, it ends with a more jazzy extended chords to lead to the first variation.

The first variation is fast and light. It has the theme with syncopation added and staccato eighths as the accompaniment. Elements of the blue scale can be found towards the end.
The second variation is like a dialogue between the melody and the bass notes. In the second half it pushs to the ending with a series of short octaves phrases with power chord in the bass in between.
The third variation is labelled rumba. The melody is transformed as syncopated where the bass takes the beat in octaves. The second half features descneding octave scales and ostinato accompaniment figures. It softens and slows down towards the end, leading to the next variation.
While the first three variation is are fast, the fourth variation is a slow one with broken chord arpeggios. It becomes more agitated in the middle, and then gradually relaxes afterwards.
The fifth variation is in the new age style. It is the only variation that is in major key, which is in a soothing mood with syncopated broken chord accompaniment. There is a key change back to the original minor key near the end of this variation.
The last variation is a fast swing variation. It starts with four bars of introduction with powerful bass and syncopated chords on the top. The theme develops through the next two 4-bar sections, followed by triplets and tremolos leading to the descending blue scales, and a series of repeated tonic chords concludes the pieces brilliantly.
