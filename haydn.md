## Haydn Piano Sonata in C, No. 60 Hob.XVI/50

### Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_Hob._XVI/50)

Piano Sonata in C major, Hob. XVI/50, L.60, was written c. 1794[1] by Joseph Haydn.

The work has three movements.[2]

1. Allegro
2. Adagio (in F major)
3. Allegro molto

The sonata was written for and dedicated to Therese Jansen Bartolozzi c. 1794.[3] Jansen Bartolozzi subsequently published the sonata c. 1800 with the title: "A Grand Sonata for the Piano Forte Composed Expressly for and dedicated to Mrs. Bartolozzi by Haydn ... Op. 79 ... London. Printed for, and to be had of the Proprietor 82 Wells Street and of the Publishers J. and H. Caulfield 36 Picadilly."

The first movement of the C major, No 50—probably the last of Haydn’s sonatas—is a ne plus ultra of thematic concentration, a brilliant, extrovert counterpart to the strenuous ‘Fifths’ Quartet, Op 76 No 2. It opens with a bald, staccato theme, virtually unharmonized and typically irregular in phrase structure—a vision of dry bones. Haydn immediately repeats and elaborates the theme, initially with full, rolling chords (presaging the orchestral style of much of the writing), then with hints of
two-part counterpoint that will have significant consequences later. This single fertile idea reappears, contrapuntally enriched, as a ‘second subject’ (with the theme initially in the bass), and is treated with endless resource in the harmonically breathtaking development. The development’s climax comes with the famous ‘open pedal’ passage, where the once-bare theme is transformed into something rich and strange in the remote key of A flat. What Haydn seems to have envisaged here was
not the sustaining pedal, as is sometimes assumed, but the una corda (i.e. soft) pedal available on the new Broadwood instruments but rarely found on contemporary Continental pianos. In the recapitulation the theme attains its lyrical apotheosis with another, more extended ‘open pedal’ passage, now ethereal rather than darkly mysterious.

After a poetically embellished, quasi-improvisatory Adagio in F—a rhapsodic meditation such as we find in many of the late piano trios—the finale is a candidate for the most subversively comic piece that even Haydn ever wrote. A scherzo in all but name, it continually baffles with its lopsided phrases (the quirky main theme consists of five plus two bars), outrageous sudden silences and disorienting feints to absurdly remote keys that, unlike Haydn’s usual practice, remain arbitrary and
unexplained to the end.

“JOSEPH HAYDN: The London Sonatas” = Sonata No. 60 in C Major, Hob. XVI/50; Sonata No. 61 in D Major, Hob. XVI/51; Sonata No. 62 in E-flat Major, Hob. XVI/52; Variations in F Minor, “Un piccolo divertimento,” Hob. XVII/6; Sonata No. 59 in E-flat Major, Hob. XVI/49 – Gottlieb Wallisch, piano – Linn multichannel SACD CKD 464, 75:00 [Distr. by Naxos]  (6/10/14) 

My first acquaintance with Linn artist Gottlieb Wallisch was through his very fine recording of Mozart piano works from the composer’s Vienna years (Linn CKD 352). These performances showed Wallisch to be a sensitive, unfussy interpreter of the classics. Since then, he has been featured on other Mozart discs, including one involving the Piatti Quartet in chamber-music settings of Mozart concertos. If I avoided that disc, it’s only because boiled-down versions of concertos aren’t my cup
of tea. But the final great quartet of Haydn piano sonatas certainly is, and I’m glad to see Wallisch turn his attention to Mozart’s older friend and colleague.

Haydn was a competent keyboardist but by no means a virtuoso, and many of his earlier works for keyboard are modest in their demands, probably reflecting both their dedicatees and the market for which they were written, publishers always hungry for new compositions for the amateur musician. During his two London sojourns, however, Haydn had contact with the finest of professional musicians, including pianist Therese Jensen (for whom he also wrote some of his greatest piano trios). And just
as Haydn’s orchestral palette expanded thanks to the large, highly professional bands for which he wrote his London Symphonies, his late sonatas reflect the virtuoso pianists and virtuoso instruments—with their expanded keyboards—for which he composed.

While Mozart wrote his sonatas for the standard five-octave instruments of his day, Haydn and Beethoven could take advantage of advancements in piano design and construction around the turn of the century. These included the addition of a half-octave to the keyboard, plus additional pedals, allowing for greater expressive control. The effect of these advantages on Haydn’s compositional style is evident in Sonata No. 60, with its eloquently songful Adagio middle movement and mercurial first
movement, where skittish runs contrast with big, bass-heavy chords and declamatory rolled ones. Like some of the movements in Haydn’s late symphonies (the finale of Symphony 103, for example), this first movement is monothematic, meaning that the second “theme” is really just a slight variant of the “first” theme. If Beethoven, as he maintained, didn’t learn much while under in Haydn’s tutelage, he later managed to learn a thing or two from movements such as these.

Therese Jansen, a prominent English pianist and former student of Clementi, was the recipient of two piano sonatas composed by Haydn—the Sonata No. 62 in E-flat major and No. 60 in C major. While the former is often considered Haydn’s greatest contribution to the genre, the Sonata in C major is by no means less interesting, or even, less adventurous than its counterpart. The two together show the great technical command that Jansen possessed over her instrument.

This first movement, a marvelous example of a sonata form constructed from a single theme, begins with what would appear to be the “bare bones” of a melody. This curious little theme, however, falling through the tonic triad and with its downward leaps of a seventh, possesses a beguiling humor and as the greatest composers have always shown: much can come from little. Fulfilling the requirements of sonata form, the theme recurs again, somewhat modified and in the key of the dominant,
as the movement’s second theme. Throughout the first movement, the melody is subjected to a range of treatments—at times, itself being embellished by ornaments, at others, being accompanied by sweeping scales or countermelodies. A most interesting transformation of the melody comes near the end of the recapitulation where it is presented as a smooth legato line with its leaping sevenths transformed into harmonious 7-6 suspensions. Also, significant use of counterpoint is present, not
only in the first movement, but throughout much of the piece and at times the texture almost gives one the impression of a Baroque keyboard piece.

Switching to an Adagio tempo and the key of the subdominant, the second movement is technically and emotionally challenging. The style of the movement is quite intricate and amply shows the intellectual prowess of its composer. Set in ternary form, the lyrical opening F major melody is contrasted by a middle section beginning with graceful descending C major scales. An embellished and somewhat altered return of the opening F major section rounds out the movement.

The finale, back in the tonic key of C major, is sheer mischievous humor. Its principal melody seems harmless enough until it abruptly, and one might even say rudely, ends with its leading note harmonized, not by the dominant chord, but by a first inversion on D sharp! Like the first movement, the entire movement is built from a single theme, though in this instance, the degree of variation is much less broad. If the first two movements of the sonata where an exercise in skill,
then the finale can be nothing else than an exercise in wit.
