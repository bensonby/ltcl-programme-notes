The concert piece Paganini Jazz by Fazıl Say, which was inspired by classical, modern and jazz styles, is reminiscent of the music of such greats as Scott Joplin, Art Tatum, Gershwin and Bernstein, and was originally designed as a charming encore work (1988); following the appreciative response of music lovers and, in particular, that of music critics, it was transformed over a perion of time into a more substantial work for piano. Briefly, the piece was rewritten and expanded a number of times between 1988 and 1995. We can evaluate the work as having taken its inspiration from Paganini's renowned "24th Capriccio", transforming it into "variations on jazz" requiring virtuoso rendition as well as being a creation open to the addition of improvisations and a variety of arrangements.
Throughout music history a number of composers have written various works inspired by the "24th Capriccio". We can count among them Liszt, Brahms, Rachmaninov and Lutoslavski. In Say's work, however, a different aspect must be noted: the composer is prepared to add various "developmental passages" and "transitional improvisations" while interpreting this work in concert. Furthermore, when the work is considered as a short encore piece, it is abbreviated in a manner deemed suitable by Say.

Fazıl Say (Turkish: [faːˈzɯl saj]; born 14 January 1970) is a Turkish pianist and composer who was born in Ankara. 

Fazıl Say was born in 1970. He was a child prodigy, who was able to do basic arithmetic with 4-digit numbers at the age of two. His father, having found out that he was playing the melody of "Daha Dün Annemizin" (Turkish version of Ah! vous dirai-je, maman) on a makeshift flute with no prior training, enlisted the help of Ali Kemal Kaya, an oboe artist and a family friend. At the age of three, Say started his piano lessons under the tutelage of pianist Mithat Fenmen.[1]

Say wrote his first piece – a piano sonata – in 1984, at the age of fourteen, when he was a student at the Conservatory of his home town Ankara. It was followed, in this early phase of his development, by several chamber works without an opus number, including Schwarze Hymnen for violin and piano and a guitar concerto. He subsequently designated as his opus 1 one of the works that he had played in the concert that won him the Young Concert Artists Auditions in New York: the Four
Dances of Nasreddin Hodja. This work already displays in essence the significant features of his personal style: a rhapsodic, fantasia-like basic structure; a variable rhythm, often dance-like, though formed through syncopation; a continuous, vital driving pulse; and a wealth of melodic ideas that may often be traced back to themes from the folk music of Turkey and its neighbours. In these respects, Fazıl Say stands to some extent in the tradition of composers like Béla Bartók, George
Enescu, and György Ligeti, who also drew on the rich musical folklore of their countries. He attracted international attention with the piano piece Black Earth (1997), in which he employs techniques made popular by John Cage's works for prepared piano.[2]

After this, Say increasingly turned to the large orchestral forms. Taking his inspiration from the poetry (and the biographies) of the writers Nâzım Hikmet and Metin Altıok, he composed works for soloists, chorus and orchestra which, especially in the case of the oratorio Nâzim, clearly take up the tradition of composers such as Carl Orff. In addition to the modern European instrumentarium, Say also makes frequent and deliberate use in these compositions of instruments from his native
Turkey, including kudüm and darbuka drums and the ney reed flute. This gives the music a colouring that sets it apart from many comparable creations in this genre. In the year 2007 he aroused international interest with his Violin Concerto 1001 Nights in the Harem, which is based on the celebrated tales of the same name, but deals specifically with the fate of seven women from a harem. Since its world premiere by Patricia Kopatchinskaja, the piece has already received further
performances in many international concert halls.[2]

Fazıl Say scored a further great success with his first symphony, the Istanbul Symphony, premiered in 2010 at the conclusion of his five-year residency at the Konzerthaus Dortmund. Jointly commissioned by the WDR and the Konzerthaus Dortmund in the framework of Ruhr. 2010, the work constitutes a vibrant and poetic tribute to the metropolis on the Bosporus and its millions of inhabitants. The same year saw the composition, among other pieces, of his Divorce String Quartet
(based on atonal principles), and commissioned works like the Piano Concerto Nirvana Burning for the Salzburg Festival and a Trumpet Concerto for the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival, premiered by Gábor Boldoczki.

For Sabine Meyer Say has also written a Clarinet Concerto that refers to the life and work of the Persian poet Omar Khayyam in response to a commission from the 2011 Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, and a Sonata for clarinet and piano (op. 42) for the Festival Kissinger Sommer in 2012. Fazıl Say’s works are issued worldwide by the renowned music publishers Schott Music of Mainz.[2]

In his works Gezi Park 1,2 and 3 (op. 48, op. 52, op. 54) from 2013/14 he musically processed the violent suppression of the protests at the Istanbul Gezi Park.[3]

For the avid classical music collector, discovering something new can be a thrilling experience. This is, of course, the driving force behind any passionate pursuit. It is especially exciting when this discovery is a purely personal one, not merely the result of an aficionado’s recommendation or a radio station’s choice of programming.

Remembering how I came across the Turkish pianist and composer Fazil Say, I think how easily his talent could have slipped under my ubiquitous musical radar. It was his ‘Paganini Variations’ which were first brought to my attention when researching a fun encore piece to perform which would leave the audience needing to know what it was they had just heard. The theme of the 24th solo violin caprice of Niccolo Paganini lends itself perfectly to the variation format – an instantly
memorable tune over a deliciously simple tonal structure. Indeed, Paganini’s original is in the form of the theme followed by 11 variations and a short coda. Everyone from Lutoslawski to Lloyd Webber has given their contribution to the Paganini Variations melting pot, and in all different instrumental combinations too – from carillon to ‘cello and rock band. The theme is not the easiest choice to create something new, something inspiring, and something ultimately worthwhile.

Fazil Say, however, relishes this task. His variations come in the style of modern jazz. Not just this, but each variation has its own distinct genre, from Rumba to New Age to Swing, with everything in between. Somehow, it works wonderfully. Say’s live performance of the work, towards the end of his disc entitled ‘Black Earth’, is simply electrifying. More often than not, there is just the right amount of restraint to allow the virtuosic passages to really fly (in the way we think of Horowitz
sounding faster than he actually was). The clarity of the finger work, especially in the streams of quick and quiet right hand notes, is especially commendable – after all, many people can play loud and fast, but playing at the opposite end of the dynamic spectrum requires far greater skill. One of Say’s greatest influences, the incomparable Art Tatum, shines through strongly here. My only complaint – and I would also register this with some of the other live Say performances I have
heard – is the tendency to rush the ends of phrases. Whilst this gives the music a gripping sense of propulsion, one can’t help but think complete technical control is being supplanted with a cheap effect. However, though a number of variations are omitted in performance compared with the original score’s version, one still gets the impression of a solid structure, in which the music hangs together well. The enormous creativity involved in the compositional process is evident from the
outset with a heavy reliance on syncopation to give a jazzy feel to a standard classical work. Overall, this is a near-perfect encore piece.
